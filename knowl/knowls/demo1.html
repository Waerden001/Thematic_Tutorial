<h1>Riemann-Roch theorem on a curve</h1>
<div>For a <a knowl="demo2">Coherent sheaf</a> on a smooth projective curve over a field k. The Riemann-Roch theorem computes the 
<a knowl="euler_characteristic">Euler characteristic</a> by the degree of the sheaf and the <a knowl="genus">genus</a> of the curve.
