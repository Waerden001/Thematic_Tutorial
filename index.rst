Welcome to the Waerden Thematic Tutorials!
==========================================

Here you will find Waerden demonstrations, quick reference cards, primers, and
thematic tutorials,

.. To be reinstated once we have some of them in the Sage sources!
.. - A *demonstration* is a short document giving a broad view of the
..   available features on a given theme; it is typically presented
..   during a talk, and lasts a couple minutes.

- A *quickref* (or quick reference card) is a one page document with
  the essential examples, and pointers to the main entry points.

- A *primer* is a document meant for a user to get started by himself
  on a theme in a matter of minutes.

- A *tutorial* is more in-depth and could take as much as an hour or
  more to get through.
